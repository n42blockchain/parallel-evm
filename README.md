# Parallel-EVM

**Parallel-EVM** is a high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution engine written in Go, designed to execute smart contract transactions in parallel. It enables significantly higher throughput by intelligently grouping non-conflicting transactions for concurrent execution.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Traditional EVMs process transactions sequentially, which becomes a bottleneck as blockchain networks scale. Parallel-EVM overcomes this by:

- **Analyzing state access patterns** of transactions
- **Grouping independent transactions**
- **Executing multiple transaction groups in parallel**
- **Safely merging state changes post execution**

This project targets developers, researchers, and infrastructure builders seeking to improve EVM throughput and scalability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Parallel Execution Engine**: Built with Go‚Äôs native concurrency primitives for performance and reliability.
- **Transaction Grouping Algorithm**: Detects read/write conflicts and clusters transactions accordingly.
- **State Merge Engine**: Ensures correctness by safely reconciling parallel execution results.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to integrate with existing Layer 1 or Layer 2 infrastructure.

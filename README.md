Parallel-EVM
Parallel-EVM is a high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution engine written in Go, designed to execute smart contract transactions in parallel. It enables significantly higher throughput by intelligently grouping non-conflicting transactions for concurrent execution.

ðŸš€ Overview
Traditional EVMs process transactions sequentially, which becomes a bottleneck as blockchain networks scale. Parallel-EVM overcomes this by:
Analyzing state access patterns of transactions
Grouping independent transactions
Executing multiple transaction groups in parallel
Safely merging state changes post execution
This project targets developers, researchers, and infrastructure builders seeking to improve EVM throughput and scalability.
